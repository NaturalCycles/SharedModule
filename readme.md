## How to use

    yarn add -D @naturalcycles/shared-module prettier tslint

This unlocks all commands listed below in "Yarn commands" section, e.g:

    yarn lint-all

By default it uses default configs for Prettier and TSLint that are included in this package (for
convenience). You can override them by putting your own `prettier.config.js` / `tslint.json` in root
folder of your project.

## Conventions

Primary language: TypeScript (`*.ts`).

All files are linted and _prettified_ upon commit (using `husky`, `lint-staged` and `prettier`).

### Folder structure

- `/dist` target dir to put compiled files into (`*.js` and additional files like `*.json`)
- `/dist-cjs` target for CommonJS files
- `/dist-esm` target for ES Modules
- `/src` for all source files
- `/scripts` for all non-production source files / scripts.
- `/src/test` for generic test-related files and utilities, integration tests.
- `/src/test/mock`
- `/src/test/integration` for integration tests (unit tests should be placed next to the file)
- `/src/@linked`
- `/src/typings`
- `/src/environments`
- `/coverage`
- `/report`
  - `/jest/unit.xml`
  - `/jest/integration.xml`
  - `/coverage-integration`

### Yarn commands

These commands are available to be called as `yarn <command>`, because they are exposed as
`npm scripts` in `node_modules/.bin/`.

#### Build commands

- `tsc-prod`: does `tsc -p tsconfig.prod.ts`
- `tsc-scripts`: does `tsc -p ./scripts/tsconfig.ts --noEmit` (type-checking for `./scripts`)

- `build`: "Development build". Checks that "everything compiles". Does
  `del ./dist && tsc && tsc-scripts`
- `bt`: "Build & Test". Does `del ./dist && tsc && tsc-scripts && test`

- `build-copy`: copies _additional files_ into `dist` folder (e.g `*.json`)
- `build-prod`: "Production build". Does `del ./dist && build-copy && tsc-prod`

#### Test commands

- `test`: alias for `jest`. Automatically detects `full-icu` module presense, adds
  `NODE_ICU_DATA=${fullICUPath}` if needed. Automatically adds `--silent` (and `JEST_SILENT` env
  var) if all tests are run.
- `test-ci`: runs test in CI environment, with coverage. Includes fix for "CircleCI out of memory
  issue"
- `test-integration`: runs Jest with `jest.integration-test.config.js` config. Which will only run
  tests from `./src/test/integration` folder.
- `test-integration-ci`
- `test-leaks`: runs Jest with `--logHeapUsage --detectOpenHandles --detectLeaks` (requires `weak`
  module to be installed in target project).

For unit tests (`yarn test`) these `setupFilesAfterEnv` will be used (if found) in that order:

- `<rootDir>/src/test/setupJest.ts`
- `<rootDir>/src/test/setupJest.unit.ts`

For integration tests (`yarn test-integration`) these `setupFilesAfterEnv` will be used (if found)
in that order:

- `<rootDir>/src/test/setupJest.ts`
- `<rootDir>/src/test/setupJest.integration.ts`

#### Lint commands

- `lint-all`: runs Prettier as we want it: first `prettier` on needed paths, then `tslint` on top of
  it
- `tslint-all`: runs `tslint` on needed paths
- `prettier-all`: runs just Prettier on needed paths
- `lint-circleci`: fails if `.circleci/config.yml` is invalid
  ([CircleCI CLI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/) must be installed before)

#### Run commands

All these commands will skip type-checking for speed (`ts-node -T`). Instead, type-checking is done
via `tsc-scripts` as a part of `build`

- `tsn`: short alias for `ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register`
- `tsn-script`: like `tsn` but for running scripts inside `./scripts` folder, will use
  `./scripts/tsconfig.json` (file will be auto-generated in not present).

#### Other commands

- `init-from-shared-module`: copied config files from `shared-module/cfg/init` to the project
- `update-from-shared-module`: copied config files from `shared-module/cfg/overwrite` to the project

## Non-extendable config files

These files cannot be _extended_, so they are instead copied into the target project: first time
when seeding the project, later manually by running `yarn update-from-shared-module`.

These files are **overwritten** in target project every time the mentioned command is run. So, be
careful! Solution is to either extend them in other way (e.g put more `.gitignore` files in
subfolders), OR PR to this project, if the need is generic.

- `.editorconfig`
- `.gitignore`
- `.codeclimate.yml` (with some work it can be made extendable later)

## Extendable config files

These files are meant to be extended in target project, so act as _recommended defaults_.

- `husky.config.js`
- `lint-staged.config.js`
- `prettier.config.js`
- `tslint.json`
- `jest.config.js`

## Dependencies

`@naturalcycles/shared-module` is supposed to be included as `devDependency`.

It has dependencies that will be installed to all modules.

ONLY the dependencies that are:

- **stable**
- safe to automatically update according to semver (e.g `^1.0.0`)

are included.

Examples of what devDeps **cannot** be included:

- `prettier`, because patch versions can change how source code is printed significantly, and we
  want to control how and when to update it.
- `tslint`, for same reasons
- `jest`

Deps that are listed here are _blessed_ and battle-tested.
